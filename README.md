# Knuckleheads

This is a game based on the Three Stooges thumping each other. 

This is an exercise based on the [*Pragmatic Studio*](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) Ruby course, which is excellent.

This is my first Ruby project.

There are 3 characters. Stooges, if you will.
In this version, the thumps are random
